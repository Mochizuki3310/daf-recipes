but we still have problems 

- Follow these steps to run the Docker images:
    
    # Create Freeipa config directory
        mkdir /var/lib/ipa-data
    


- On your file hosts add this entry 
        vi /etc/hosts
        172.17.0.1	ipa.example.test


- Run Freeipa container:

        ./startfreeipa.sh
