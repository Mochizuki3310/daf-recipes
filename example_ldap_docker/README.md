### Login
After running the docker-compose go to *http://localhost* and log in as user *cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org* and password *admin*.

Now you are able to navigate through the LDAP dataset. We have create three ou, i.e. users, admin and developers, and one user named pippo (with password *password*).
